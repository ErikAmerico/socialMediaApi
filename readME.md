# Social Network API

## Description
This application marks the beginning of a full-stack social networking platform leveraging Express.js routing, MongoDB database, and the Mogoose ODM framework. It establishes the foundational CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API routes for the platform. These routes enable users to be created, searched for, updated and deleted. The ability for a user to share their thoughts, edit a previously shared thought, view a specic thought or all thoughts, and eventually delete their thought, is granted through this application. Users also have the ability to add their reaction to any posted thought, and the choice to then delete that reaction later on. Another cool feature is the adding and removing of friends to a users friend list.

While this application is in its early stages, it is a solid building block for the future development of this social networking app.
